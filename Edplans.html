<h3>Educational plans</h3>
          <p> I am going to get the bachlaur diploma and the magistrature diploma. Also, for me is important to increase my English level to Advanced. It is great idea to start learning the new language.</p>
<h3>Professional plans</h3>
<p>It is good to start my own business in the sales, marketing and IT fields. After university, I am planning to continue my way as a manager but maybe try another direction like a product manager as an example. </p>
