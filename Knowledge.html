<h3>Knowledge of programming languages</h3>
          <p> I started to learn coding in April 2020. My first experience was studing C and make own SDL-Game. Although I like everything that have connection with the games, I decided to try Web and Design. So, I have some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and Photoshop</p>
