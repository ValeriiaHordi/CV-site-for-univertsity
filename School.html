      <p>My favourite subjects were English, Chemistry and Biology. There were really great teachers in my school, so it was one of the reasons why I liked these subjects. In the last years of the school, I thought about medical field but in the last moment I decided that it wasn't mine. So, because of this, I had choice between chemistry and biology. In conclusion, I chose chemical department.</p>
